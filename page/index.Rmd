The [dissertation_evidentiality](https://github.com/sverhees/dissertation_evidentiality) repository contains data collected for my PhD project on **Evidentiality as part of tense-aspect in East Caucasian languages** (2015--2019). The full text of my dissertation (in Russian) and summaries in Russian and English can be downloaded [here](https://www.hse.ru/sci/diss/300367563). An overview paper in English is currently in preparation.

This page introduces the data. It features searchable datatables and interactive maps.

In the repository you will find the following data:

* Tables with data on evidential markers
* Annotated surveys
* Annotated narrative data

# Introduction

**Evidential** markers indicate how a person came to know about the event they are talking about, for example personal experience, logical inference or hearsay.

In the Caucasus this category is commonly expressed with a perfect form of the verb, indicating that the speaker did not witness the event. Other means to express evidentiality include particles and specialized auxiliaries (see an overview in [@forker2018evid]).

My dissertation focused on the question to what extent evidentiality as a meaning of the perfect is grammaticalized in languages of the East Caucasian family, and additionally: whether it could have emerged under the influence of local Turkic languages. So in addition to comparing form and function, I plotted various maps to visualize the areal distribution of features.

# Data

## Evidential markers

To compare the form and function of evidential markers, I looked at descriptive grammars and papers on 44 idioms of 32 languages (all of the traditionally recognized East Caucasian languages + 3 Turkic languages, and some additional lects). A full list of sources can be found in the `bibliography.bib` file in the [page](https://github.com/sverhees/dissertation_evidentiality/page) folder of this repository.

### The perfect

* All East Caucasian languages have 1--4 forms resembling a perfect[^1]
* Many, but not all of these forms express evidentiality
* Chechen and Tsakhur employ a specialized auxiliary to express evidentiality[^2]

The forms in question look quite similar: most common are periphrastic constructions with a converb and a present tense copula.

```{r}

table(pf$lex_type, pf$aux_type)

```

[^1]: "a form resembling a perfect" is a rather vague definition. It means that each language of the family has a form with a similar or reconstructible formal structure typical of perfects (past or perfective nonfinite form + a present auxiliary), and a similar functional range, which includes but is not limited to resultative (in the narrow sense), perfect or current relevance, and indirect evidentiality. 
[^2]: In Tsakhur this auxiliary is also part of the perfect.

The perfect can express tense-aspect and evidentiality at the same time, when the speaker *infers* from some result or consequence at speech time that a certain event occurred in the past.

If it is sufficiently grammaticalized as an evidential marker, the perfect can refer to an unwitnessed event in the past that has no such link to the moment of speech. It is important to note that a single form can function as a full-fledged unwitnessed past in some contexts (most importantly narrative sequences), while retaining prototypical perfect functions in other contexts.

In some languages, the general past is considered a grammaticalized marker of direct evidentiality (witnessed past), in contrast with the perfect, which expresses indirect evidentiality (unwitnessed past). Since these direct forms also occur in nonwitnessed contexts, they could simply be neutral forms that carry witnessed overtones in particular contexts.

In the table below you can find all the forms I labeled as perfects or rather -- **perfectoids**: forms that are very similar to the cross-linguistic perfect category, but which might not have current relevance (the prototypical meaning of the perfect) as their main function.[^3] (I am still working on linking the sources to their full references.)

[^3]: A more detailed discussion of perfect typology and my decisions in classifying certain forms can be found in my dissertation, or more briefly in the slides from my defense.

<br>

#### Table: Perfectoids

```{r}

dataperf <- pf %>%
 select(form, type, evidential, meaning, lang, idiom, ref)

colnames(dataperf)[4] <- c("function")

datatable(dataperf, class = 'cell-border stripe', rownames = F, filter = 'top', options = list(pageLength = 70, autoWidth = T, info = FALSE, paginate = FALSE))

```

### Clitics

Specialized evidential morphemes in East Caucasian usually come in the form of clitic particles. Some of them attach to inflected verbs, while others are focus sensitive particles that can attach to any type of constituent (though they attach to the verb by default). These clitics often originate from verbs of speech, with some languages featuring petrified verb forms or even full verbs used as clitics. The vast majority of clitics mark reported speech. Inferential and general indirect particles are attested only in two languages.

Not all reported speech clitics are evidentials. Most of them are quotative particles, used to mark the boundaries of a quotation, rather than indicate the source of information per se. In East Caucasian a single morpheme can function both as a quotative and a reportative particle. The latter indicates that the information was based on hearsay. In my data, I labeled as "evidential" all of the clitics *known* to have a reportative function.

The data on clitics suffer from descriptive gaps. Particles are an underdescribed word class, and classification is inconsistent.

<br>

#### Table: clitics for reported speech and inference

```{r}

datapart <- part %>%
 select(form, type, meaning, evidential, lang, variant, ref)

colnames(datapart)[c(3,6)] <- c("function", "idiom")

datatable(datapart, class = 'cell-border stripe', rownames = F, filter = 'top', options = list(pageLength = 77, autoWidth = T, info = FALSE, paginate = FALSE))

```

## Surveys

The aim of the surveys I conducted was to check whether the perfect in certain idioms has an evidential meaning. Second, I wanted to verify its grammatical status by comparing the use of past tense forms in a limited context across speakers.

1. **Small evidentiality survey**: A short survey aimed at eliciting evidential forms
2. **The Perfect Questionnaire**: Questionnaire aimed at eliciting different functions of the perfect [@dahl2000]
3. **Narrative test**: An elaboration of the questions from the Perfect Questionnaire where speakers are asked to translate a short narrative

The surveys are currently available as tables with the following information:

* discursive context
* sentence for translation
* translat_original - the initial translation written down in Cyrillic orthography
* translit_morph - the transliteration of the answer with morpheme boundaries
* gloss
* translation - if applicable, a translation of the answer
* target_verb
* target_translation
* expected answer
* given answer
* metadata: speaker, idiom, language, gender, birthyear, date of elicitation

At some point I will convert this to .tex and .pdf also.

### Small evidentiality survey

The small evidentiality survey consists of 11 questions, some of which elicit multiple sentences.[^1] The table below displays the number of sentences elicited from each speaker in conjunction with their language and idiom. This survey was exploratory in nature.

[^1]: The survey has different versions for male and female consultants.

```{r}

es_content <- es %>%
  select(language, idiom, speaker) %>%
  group_by(language, idiom, speaker) %>%
  summarise(sentences = n())

es_content

```

### The Perfect Questionnaire

To be added...


### Narrative test

The narrative test consists of two similar short narratives. In one version the speaker is renarrating an anecdote about their grandmother, in the other they are relating a memory from personal experience.

I conducted the test with speakers of different Andi dialects.

```{r}

pn_content <- pn %>%
  filter(!duplicated(speaker)) %>%
  select(language, idiom) %>%
  group_by(language, idiom) %>%
  summarise(speakers = n())

pn_content

```

The general past (aorist) and the perfect were most frequent across speakers. The perfect was restricted almost exclusively to sequences about unwitnessed events, whereas the aorist was not infrequent in both the direct and indirect contexts.

<br>

#### Figure: Verb forms used in the narrative test

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 8.2}

pn_forms <- pn %>%
  select(form_label, context, speaker, idiom) %>%
  group_by(context, form_label) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

ggdotchart(pn_forms, x = "form_label", y = "count",
           color = "context",
           palette = c("navy", "mediumorchid1"), 
           sorting = "descending",
           add = "segments",
           dot.size = 2,
           xlab = "",
           ylab = "",
           rotate = TRUE)
```

The graph below shows individual speakers' deviations from my expectations, assuming a strict opposition of direct (aorist/past) vs. indirect (perfect) evidentiality. Ideally, the proportions should be 50/50.

<br>

#### Figure: Proportion of expected vs. given pasts (aorists) and perfects per speaker

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 8.2}

given <- pn %>%

  group_by(speaker, given) %>%
  rename(form = given) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(set = "given")

expected <- pn %>%
  select(speaker, exp) %>%
  filter(exp %in% c("past", "perfect")) %>%
  group_by(speaker, exp) %>%
  rename(form = exp) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(set = "expected")

given_expected <- rbind(given, expected)

ggplot(given_expected, aes(x = form, y = count, fill = set)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="RdPu")+
  facet_wrap(~speaker)+
  theme_classic()

```

# Maps

Below is a partial reproduction of the map [`78A. Coding of Evidentiality`](http://wals.info/feature/78A#2/16.6/149.8) [@wals-78] from the [World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS)](https://wals.info/) online. It shows only the East Caucasian languages from the sample. Hover over the dots to view the language they represent, and click to see the source reference.

The category **Part of the tense system** comprises languages with an evidential perfect and Chechen, which features a specialized auxiliary used to form indirect evidential tenses. **Mixed** refers to languages that combine tense forms with a **Verbal affix or clitic**.

#### Map: Evidentiality in the eastern Caucasus (WALS)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 8.2, fig.height= 7}

# filter wals data

wals <- sys[complete.cases(sys$coding),]

# draw map

map.feature(lang.gltc(wals$gltc),
            latitude = wals$lat,
            longitude = wals$lon,
            features = wals$coding,
            color = wals$col,
            title = "Coding of Evidentiality",
            width = 8,
            tile = c("Esri.WorldTopoMap"),
            zoom.level = 6,
            label = wals$lang,
            popup = wals$ref)

```

Based on the sources I used, individual languages received a different classification than they have on the WALS map (see my [issue](https://github.com/clld/wals-data/issues/164) at Github).

The map below also includes local Turkic languages (Azerbaijani, Kumyk, Nogai) in addition to the East Caucasian languages.

#### Map: Evidentiality in the eastern Caucasus (my data)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 8.2, fig.height= 7}

# draw map

map.feature(lang.gltc(sys$gltc),
            latitude = sys$lat,
            longitude = sys$lon,
            features = sys$corr,
            color = sys$corr_col,
            title = "Coding of Evidentiality",
            width = 8,
            tile = c("Esri.WorldTopoMap"),
            zoom.level = 6,
            label = sys$lang,
            popup = sys$corr_ref)
```

Both maps show similar areal patterns. Evidentiality as part of the tense system seems less characteristic of the southeastern part of the area.

The map below illustrates the distribution of evidentiality as part of the tense system, fusing the categories **Part of the tense system** and **Mixed** from the previous maps.

#### Map: Evidentiality as part of tense in the eastern Caucasus

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 8.2, fig.height= 7}

sys <- sys %>%
  mutate(tense = case_when(
    corr == "Part of the tense system" ~ "yes", 
    corr == "Mixed" ~"yes",
    TRUE ~ "no"))

sys_col <- left_join(sys, col, by = "lang")

sys_col$tense <- factor(sys_col$tense, levels = c("yes", "no"))

sys_col$lang <- factor(sys_col$lang, levels = c("Ingush", "Chechen", "Bats", "Bezhta", "Hinuq", "Hunzib", "Khwarshi", "Tsez", "Avar", "Akhvakh", "Andi", "Bagvalal", "Botlikh", "Chamalal", "Godoberi", "Karata", "Tindi", "Dargwa", "Lak", "Agul", "Archi", "Budukh", "Kryz", "Lezgian", "Rutul", "Tabasaran", "Tsakhur", "Udi", "Khinalug", "Kumyk", "Nogai", "Azerbaijani"))


map.feature(lang.gltc(sys_col$gltc),
            features = sys_col$lang,
            title = "Language",
            color = sys_col$datacol,
            width = 5,
            stroke.features = sys_col$tense,
            stroke.color = c("grey", "white"),
            stroke.title = "Evidentiality and tense",
            stroke.radius = 13,
            label = sys_col$lang,
            zoom.level = 7,
            popup = paste("Source(s):", sys_col$corr_ref),
            tile = c("Esri.WorldGrayCanvas"))
```


The next map shows whether the perfect has an evidential meaning.

sys_col$perfect <- factor(sys_col$perfect, levels = c("yes", "no"))

map.feature(lang.gltc(sys_col$gltc),
            features = sys_col$lang,
            title = "Language",
            color = sys_col$datacol,
            width = 5,
            stroke.features = sys_col$perfect,
            stroke.color = c("grey", "white"),
            stroke.title = "Evidentiality and tense",
            stroke.radius = 13,

            popup = paste("Source(s):", sys_col$corr_ref),
            tile = c("Esri.WorldGrayCanvas"))
```

The map below compares the distribution of evidentiality as part of tense to different types of evidential clitics, which range from cliticized verbs to free particles. The latter does not show a clear areal or genealogical signal.

As the map shows, most dots from the top layer correspond to a multitude of villages. Each of these villages represents an idiom that might differ from the one described in the sources I used. (This problem is especially relevant for Dargwa.) In addition, some of the sources may be incomplete. Many of the red dots could actually be grey, because specialized clitics are underdescribed and often misclassified. It is less likely for the pink and white dots to be inaccurate, because these languages are relatively well-studied with respect to this topic (with the exception of Tabasaran).

As a result, the southern part of the area forms a reliably distinct zone, which roughly coincides with the area where Azerbaijani was historically dominant as an L2 and lingua franca. The map below plots the major market cities and their dominant lingua franca against the villages and languages, based on [@wixman1980]. 

#### Map: All East Caucasian languages + market languages

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 8.2, fig.height=8}

vill_col$lang <- factor(vill_col$lang, levels =c(
  "Dargwa", "Lak", "Bats", "Ingush", "Chechen", "Khinalug", "Archi", "Tsakhur", "Rutul", "Kryz", "Budukh", "Udi", "Lezgian", "Agul", "Tabasaran", "Avar", "Andi", "Botlikh", "Godoberi", "Chamalal", "Bagvalal", "Tindi", "Karata", "Akhvakh", "Tsez", "Hinuq", "Bezhta", "Hunzib", "Khwarshi", "Armenian", "Kumyk", "Nogai", "Azerbaijani"))

# draw map

map.feature(lang.gltc(vill_col$gltc),
            latitude = vill_col$lat,
            longitude = vill_col$lon,
            features = vill_col$lang,

            label = vill_col$lang,
            popup = paste("Village:", vill_col$name)) %>%
                        map.feature(market$lang,
                        latitude = market$lat,
                        longitude = market$lon,
                        features = market$lang,
                        popup = paste("market language of", market$city),
                        label = market$lang,
                        title = "Lingua Franca",
                        shape =  c("❖", "⬖", "◇", "◆"),
                        shape.size = "30",
                        tile = c("Esri.WorldTopoMap"),
                        legend.position = "topleft",
                        pipe.data = .)

```

Based on the sources I used, Kumyk and Nogai have an evidential perfect, while the Azerbaijani perfect has lost its evidential function. This coincides nicely with the observed areal distribution of presence vs. absence of evidentiality as a meaning of the perfect. However, a scenario that links the emergence of evidentiality (or lack thereof) in East Caucasian perfects to contact with Turkic languages cannot be confirmed, due to a large number of complications elaborated in my paper.
